## 4. Tokenomics Analysis

### Proposed Model: Bitcoin Rewards with Partner Token Buybacks

#### Core Mechanics
1. **User Flow**
   - User scans receipt → Earns points
   - Points convert to Bitcoin rewards
   - Withdrawal at any amount (no minimums)

2. **Partner Integration**
   - Partner allocates budget for token buybacks
   - System automatically buys partner tokens with BTC
   - Users in partner ecosystem receive partner tokens
   - Creates constant buy pressure on partner token

#### Revenue Distribution Model

| Revenue Stream | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| Data Monetization (40%) | User rewards | Direct Bitcoin payments to users |
| Data Monetization (30%) | Operations | Platform development, servers, team |
| Whitelabel Fees (50%) | Partner buybacks | Purchase partner tokens for distribution |
| Whitelabel Fees (30%) | Platform revenue | Business operations and growth |
| Whitelabel Fees (20%) | User bonuses | Extra rewards for whitelabel users |

### Why This Model Works

1. **For Users**
   - Immediate value in Bitcoin (no gift card restrictions)
   - Potential upside if partner tokens appreciate
   - Transparent reward system

2. **For Partners**
   - Creates real utility for token holders
   - Generates consistent buy pressure
   - Provides valuable consumer data
   - Lower CAC than traditional user acquisition

3. **For Platform**
